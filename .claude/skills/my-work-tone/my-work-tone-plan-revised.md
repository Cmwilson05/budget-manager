## Project: Create `my-work-tone` SKILL.md  
### Purpose  
To formalize Chrystopher Wilson’s professional communication style into a reusable, machine-readable **SKILL.md** named **my-work-tone**, capturing tone, structure, phrasing, workflow behaviors, identity markers, and interaction patterns.  
This skill will guide AI tools to write in Chrystopher’s authentic voice across emails, chat responses, documentation, and support messaging.

3. Provide modular, referenceable guidelines for consistent application by automation or AI assistants.  
4. Capture **professional identity markers** such as signature conventions, scheduling workflows, and documentation style.
5. Create sections and templates that support fast, reliable, repeatable communication output.
